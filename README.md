#OG XBOX XBMC Resources

This is a collection of Resources for the XBMC Media Center on the Original XBOX.
These Resources are used Display Games installed on the Harddrive in a beautiful manner with Game covers, Fanarts, Screenshots, Icons and Animated CDs
These Resources should be used together with the XBMC Origins Skin for the best looks.
The CD Pictures I edited are not that well done mostly and some are even worse because I couldn't find any good scans of the original CDs on the Internet. Any Help in making better edits would be greatly appreciated.

##How to use these Files:
Just put the _resources folder into the folder of your Game. For Halo it would look like this:
```
_resources
bink
maps_de (Dependant on the Region of your Halo Disk)
maps_fr (Dependant on the Region of your Halo Disk)
Xdemos
default.xbe
```

##How to Contribute:
Just open a Pull-Request with your added resources :D

##Some Information:
- CDs need to be 256x256 and be a .png file (CDs NEED to be in .png since we need support for transparency. This means that you will have - to remove all the white added by scanning the CDs so that everything except the actual CD is transparent)
- Fanarts need to be 853x480 and be a .jpg file
- Icons need to be 256x256 and be a .jpg file
- Posters need to be 256x364 and be a .jpg file
- Thumbnails need to be 455x256 and be a .jpg file

##A perfect Resource Pack should contain the following files:
```
cd.png
fanart.jpg
icon.jpg
poster.jpg
thumb.jpg
```
